### Objective

 List the goal of the tasks here. It does not need to be long, and can take the form of a user story, e.g. "As a user, I would like to X, so that I can X", or "As a user, I would like to be able to right-click and delete an item, so that I don't have to move my mouse all the way up to the top of the screen."
 
### Tech Spec

<Insert screenshots/wireframe/visual content of finished feature>

_Clearly_ outline the expectations for the tasks here. Place them in the form of TODOs. For example:

- [ ] Include a "Delete" option in the right-click menu for item 
- [ ] Wire the "Delete" option to the DELETE_TEM system event 
  - [ ] Write unit test for delete operation
  - [ ] User may _not_ delete item if multiple items are selected

Also add condition material, if needed:

- [ ] When the user is logged into a free account, disallow deletion

### Design Artifacts

Provide a list of design artifacts on which the above tech spec is based. This could be an external link to an artifact the Design or UX team provided. Include authors names so that the task owner can reach out.

### Notes

Any clarifying content unrelated to the above items (Or, just a word of encouragement, like "You're doing great!")
