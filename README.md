## Code Walkthrough :computer:
Inside the source folder, you'll find components, containers (pages), and utilities.

Each page has its own container, and each container is comprised of components.

`App.tsx` is responsible for rendering each container as its own route.

We use styled-components as our CSS-in-JS solution.
